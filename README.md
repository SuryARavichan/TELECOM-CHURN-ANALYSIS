Project Roadmap: Telecom Churn Prediction and Analysis

Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preparation

Task 1: Acquire the telecom dataset with the provided attributes, including call details records (CDR) and customer interaction data. Task 2: Assess the dataset's quality, completeness, and relevance for predicting telecom churn. Task 3: Perform initial data cleaning, addressing missing values and data inconsistencies in the telecom dataset.

Phase 2: Data Exploration and Visualization

Task 4: Explore the telecom dataset to understand its structure, customer behaviors, and call patterns. Task 5: Visualize data patterns and relationships between variables, with a focus on identifying potential indicators of churn. Task 6: Identify and visualize potential outliers and anomalies in the telecom data.

Phase 3: Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

Task 7: Perform univariate and bivariate analyses to gain insights into individual variables and their correlations with customer churn. Task 8: Develop new features through feature engineering techniques, considering variables that may impact churn prediction. Task 9: Apply outlier detection methods to ensure data integrity in the context of telecom churn.

Phase 4: Predictive Modeling and Recommendations

Task 10: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for predicting telecom churn. Task 11: Build predictive models tailored to specific use cases, such as customer retention or network optimization. Task 12: Evaluate model performance and fine-tune as necessary for accurate churn prediction.

Phase 5: Reporting and Documentation

Task 13: Summarize key findings and insights obtained throughout the project, emphasizing factors contributing to telecom churn. Task 14: Create compelling data visualizations to present complex patterns related to telecom churn. Task 15: Prepare a comprehensive report documenting the analysis, modeling approaches, and actionable recommendations for addressing churn.

Phase 6: Real-World Applications

Task 16: Apply the insights and predictive models to address real-world business challenges in telecom, focusing on reducing customer churn and enhancing service quality. Task 17: Assess the impact of data-driven recommendations on improving telecom operations and decision-making related to customer retention.

Project Conclusion and Future Steps

Task 18: Conclude the project by summarizing key findings and their implications for telecom churn prediction. Task 19: Discuss potential future extensions or refinements, such as integrating additional data sources or implementing automation for ongoing churn analysis and prediction in the telecom domain.
